# ONLINE EXAM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Our system is comprised of few important interfaces or we can say modules behind it so here we will discuss the modules related to all those interfaces and workflow further.

# User Registration
A user here is student basically but we can say it, user, here. One need to provide his details like name, address, phone number, email. These are required then enter his hit to make it saved in the database. Then we need it to use the credentials for further access.

# Login 
Login with the registered credentials and then move to the interface where available exams are shown.

# Admin
Admin panel is specially designed to facilitate all tasks that need to be done or attempted by the student user.

# Set exam
Admin is responsible for all kind of operation in the exams of students he designs the question paper according to the teacher of the subject in the portal and then after all kind of work like sending space for subjective type questions limiting space words and for mc q instant evaluation and for other result kind of activity it is going to update.

# Attempt Exam
Next we have the interface for the students where one can after login can see the exams available in their accounts and then they attempt that on particular venue provided for particular duration of time and then he can move in the portal too and forth for the selection of attempt questions and can finish before time as their wish.

# Staff
Here staff’s data is mentioned with their all credentials and mainly focusing on the exam purpose they have the option to get the info on the duty venue of the exam where they have to give duty and at what time and which subject.

so as they are required to avoid the cheating incidences. so here they can go for it.

# Results
Results of the exam are to be shown in this module . in this part the student ‘s result for the mc q are shown at the moment but we have the options of subjective type questions which are needed to be checked manually by the teacher as at the moment.

We don’t have such technology which can evaluate the subjective type question precisely as every student has their own way of writing the question so it difficult for the system.

So leaving it to the future. But for now, we have the option of making a system where one can evaluate all the given answer on online portal without the involvement of the pen and paper.

As after evaluation teacher give every question with answering particular marks from given weight – age of question which are calculated in the end and made available in the portal of the student account the given test or exam marks. Here they can see and improve their marks in future.
